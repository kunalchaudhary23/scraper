Until now, people have given their data away to companies in exchange for centralized access to application and services. Examples include uploading and tagging photos, tracking and sharing your location and access to purchase history, to name a few. To provide a fair and balanced intelligence available to all equally, we must create AI economies that any agent can participate in and receive some reward for doing so. Enter Synapse AI. Synapse AI solves this problem by tokenizing an agent's work on the Synapse AI market using SYN utility tokens, thus facilitating an economy between participants and transferring value to those participants. This accelerates a system that grows beyond the means of capacity of any one single company or organization. By opening this data and using machine learning models through decentralized marketplace formats on the blockchain, and by tokenizing contributors, we can create syndicates that provide the greatest benefit to users everywhere.

Using transparent ledgers which can be seen by anyone and which cannot be tampered with, we provide parents with a system that guarantees peace of mind. Not only are parents able to earn up to 40% rewards from purchases of Baby and Maternity products within the FamilyPoints ecosystem, but they can spend it on a variety of services through the platform, especially on child education services. With a fully transparent ecosystem, parents can also trust that the reviews they see for products and service providers are completely honest. FamilyPoints is the first platform of its kind to be based on blockchain, a new technology which offers the FamilyPoints community a secure and transparent platform for transactions, referral programs, rewards, reviews, and education services. By cutting out the middleman, we can provide rewards which have real-world economic value to parents. We work directly with selected producers and brands, eliminate all unnecessary markups, and pass the savings on to parents. For parents who make a purchase, the rewards they receive can vary from between 5% to 40% of the cost of purchase. Parents can spend their rewards on the FamilyPoints platform to buy different kinds of services, from access to educational videos, to classes, and even insurance or family holidays which are focused on children and parents. Parents may even have the option to convert their rewards to cash in the future. The platform currently offers educational services that include online courses, live consultations with experts (beta version), access to the biggest parenting library in the world with 1,150 educational videos, webinars, and booking for offline classes centers. For customers, this means that FamilyPoints can also provide educational services and satisfy the needs of parents and children. We encourage customers to post content and provide feedback about the products and services we offer on FamilyPoints. Other users can then upvote helpful content and reviews with points (similar to Steem.it\u2019s service).

The p2p network is akin to a membership organization and consists of both lenders and borrowers; users must complete their Celsius profile in order to join the Celsius Network. These Celsius profiles are dynamic and change according to the users\u2019 history on the platform. The platform then proceeds to match borrowers with lenders by determining borrower credit limits and interest rates with accepting lenders. Smart technology is then used to bind the lender-borrower relationship. Borrowers\u2019 metrics are ascertained using the Celsius score - a digital credit score calculated using various metrics such as FICO scores, mortgage histories as well as non-traditional ones such as Uber and Amazon transaction histories. The Celsius platform serves lenders by allowing them to decide who they will extend credit to using borrowers\u2019 Celsius scores to determine their risk threshold. The decentralized lending platform hands the power of financial responsibility back to the general public by taking it away from the behemoth banks. Celsius helps build a trusted community, the success of which is pegged to the success of the Network itself. The firm is a non-profit organization and acts in the best interests of its members through lower fees and no hidden-fees.

This problem covers all aspects of the gambling industry, from PRND to payments. The combination of open source PNRG and the processing of all external transactions using the blockchain ensures provably fair gambling.
